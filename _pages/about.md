## About Me
I'm a computer science graduate, self-taught game developer, ex-cloud engineer, and Brazilian Jiu Jitsu/Muay Thai practitioner.<br/><br/>
I began my game development journey with Unity Engine in 2019. I've built countless prototypes of the game ideas I've had ever since then. These include endless runners and casual mobile games. I recently switched game engines to Godot, learning GDScript from scratch.<br/><br/>

This website is my journal documenting my game development journey, showing off cool features I made in Godot Engine. <br/><br/>
Feel free to check out my blog posts and projects to see what I'm working on!
